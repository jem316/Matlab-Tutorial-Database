<h1><center> Code of Conduct </center></h1>
<h2> Overview </h2>
The following document will be used to convey the rules and working environment our group has agreed to abide by. Our group will be open to new ideas and be respectful to each other in all ways. In an attempt to foster a safe work environment, I will outline the guidelines that our group, and any future group that works on the project needs to follow.
<h2> Guidelines </h2>
<h3> Positive and Constructive Feedback </h3>
Be open to new ideas and respectful of ideas that might not be best to implement. It is important to have a level of trust between group members so everyone can feel comfortable contributing.
<h3> Language </h3>
Use appropriate language when meeting during SCRUMs. Do not use language that might be hurtful or abusive towards one another. It will help meetings be more productive and keep inclusiveness as a priority.
<h3> Communication </h3>
Communication is very important, and being upfront can mitigate the unecessary arguments or disputes that might arise. These arguments can be prevented and focus can be moved towards progressing the project. Lack of communication between group members is counterproductive and will not lead to new innovative solutions. 
<h3> Coonclusion </h3>

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Any type of behavior that is abusive or harrasing should be addressed and taken care of. It is important to follow these guidelines and create a safe working environment.
